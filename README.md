# Flock Conceptâ€”Social Restaurant Discovery

This was a personal project that was never released created on React Native, Firebase, Heroku, and Elasticsearch.

The idea was to discover restaurants by following a particular user, group of users, or even demographic (age, ethnicity, locality, job, etc). Recommendations are made by automatic geolocated check-ins where preferences are inferred by length of visit, frequency of visits, and various other criteria.
